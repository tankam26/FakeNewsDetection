    <h1>Until I Found You</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            I was drifting through days,  <br>
Chasing echoes and fading rays,   <br>
Never knowing love could feel this true —   <br>
Until I found you. <br>

I’d heard the songs,   <br>
Seen the stars,   <br>
But none of them ever felt like ours.   <br>
Then you smiled, and suddenly I knew —   <br>
I’d been waiting for you. <br>

So here I am, heart in hand,   <br>
Not just hoping you’ll understand,   <br>
But asking —   <br>
Would you let me be the one   <br>
Who loves you like the sun loves the morning dew? <br> <br>

Because I never knew what love could do…   <br> <br>
Until I found you.
